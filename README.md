The SAIEP Industry Project is a 2-week experience where teams of student consultants complete an industry report for a real world client. Using secondary research, teams will undertake in-depth analysis and provide recommendations to help their client's organisation overcome a current business challenge and assist their business.

Teams will share their research and recommendations with their client throughout the 2-weeks and receive feedback along the way. By participating, learners will build and develop their transferable Global Skills, Technical competencies, and gain real industry experience leading to improved employability.
